# 🏆 MVP Leaderboard — Sportsdunia Assignment

This project implements the MVP (Most Valuable Player) Leaderboard required for the Sportsdunia Mobile Application Developer assessment. The system fetches player and event data, computes MVP scores based on the provided rules, sorts the players, and displays the leaderboard with a toggle for top performers.

- React.js
- Axios (for API calls)
- CSS (custom styling)

### Backend

- Jackson (JSON parsing)
- Maven

## 📌 Features Implemented

### ✔ MVP Score Calculation
The backend computes a score for every player using the following rules:

| Action                | Points |
|----------------------|--------|
| TAKE_WICKET          | +20    |
| 50_RUNS_MILESTONE    | +15    |
| HIT_SIX              | +2     |
| HIT_FOUR             | +1     |

### ✔ Sorted Leaderboard
- Players are sorted by MVP score in **descending order**
- Dense ranking format is used (1, 2, 3…)

### ✔ Toggle Top Performers
- A button switches between:
  - Showing **all players**
  - Showing players with **score ≥ 20**

### ✔ Clean UI Design
- Card-based layout
- Responsive styling
- Highlighted score and rank indicators
